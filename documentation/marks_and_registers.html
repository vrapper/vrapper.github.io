<h2>Marks and Registers</h2>

<h3>Marks</h3>

<p>
    Any position in the text may be marked using <code>m&lt;x&gt;</code> where &lt;x&gt; is
    a character from a-z. You can jump to a mark with <code>`x</code> and to the begin of the
    line where the mark is set with <code>'x</code>. Lowercase marks are local to the editor in
    which they are set.
</p>

<p>
    Uppercase marks (A-Z) and marks 0-9 mark positions in a specific file and
    are defined globally.
</p>

<p>There are a couple special marks which are automatically updated:</p>
<table class="commands">
    <tr><td>'<br/>`</td><td>Position of last jump</td></tr>
    <tr><td>.</td><td>Position of last change</td></tr>
    <tr><td>^</td><td>Position of last insert</td></tr>
    <tr><td>[</td><td>First character of previously changed text</td></tr>
    <tr><td>]</td><td>Last character of previously changed text</td></tr>
    <tr><td>&lt;</td><td>First character of previous visual mode selection</td></tr>
    <tr><td>&gt;</td><td>Last character of previous visual mode selection</td></tr>
</table>

<p>All marks are motions and can be combined with operators.</p>

    Vrapper also supports some registers for storing text and operations.
    Please refer to Vim documentation for their use (see <code>:help registers</code> in Vim)
