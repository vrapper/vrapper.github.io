<h2>Basics</h2>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>The preferred way of installation is to use the Eclipse update site:</p>
<pre>http://vrapper.sourceforge.net/update-site/stable</pre>
<p>If you downloaded a file release, put the jar files contained in the zip file you downloaded in the "plugins" and "features" directories of your eclipse installation.</p>
<p>If the plugin works correctly you will be able to see a "Vim" icon in the toolbar after you start up Eclipse.</p>

<h3>Using the plugin</h3>
<img src="../img/toolbar_button.png" style="float:right;" />
<p>Click the "Vim" button in the toolbar. You can now use your favorite Vim commands in the editor (assuming they are implemented).</p>
<p>Click the button again to deactivate Vim emulation in open editors.</p>
<p>If you do not like clicking the icon, you can define a keyboard shortcut for the action. Go to Preferences-&gt;General-&gt;Keys and type "vrapper" in the filter. You can the define a shortcut for the "Toggle Vrapper" command.</p>
