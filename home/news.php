    <h4>0.58.0 Released</h4>

    <p>Development for Vrapper is slowing to a halt.  We're all too busy to find
    the time to make enhancements anymore.  I apologize to all of you who have
    been filing new enhancement requests which we've been ignoring.  Hopefully
    we'll find the time to implement some of them here and there.  However,
    Vrapper is stable and has lots of features so I'm hoping most users are
    happy with the current state of things.</p>
    <p>With all that said, there were some fixes in the last couple months so
    I'm releasing another new version.  Here are the changes:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed issue where :g command with 'normal' wouldn't return to normal mode</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with :g command and 'normal' inserting newlines</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with 'o' and 'cleanindent' at the end of a file</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with 'A-O' from insert mode not returning to insert mode</li>
        <li>Fixed issue where selecting text within a fold didn't open the fold</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with mouse-selections going over a fold</li>
        <li>Fixed display of mode and recording status when using Eclipse's dark themes</li>
        <li>Fixed selection highlighting when using 'c'onfirm flag for substitutions</li>
        <li>Fixed performance issue with search highlighting</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Thank you to all the users who have used and enjoyed Vrapper throughout the years!</p>

    <h4>0.56.0 Released</h4>

    <p>It's been a bit of a slow month for us.  There weren't many changes
    but it's been two months so I might as well do another release.
    Here are the changes since my last update</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed issue where some jumps weren't added to Eclipse history and &lt;C-O&gt;/&lt;C-I&gt;</li>
        <li>Fixed issue where setting a string option to "" wouldn't clear the value</li>
        <li>Fixed issue where `:s//` wouldn't clear previous search</li>

    <h4>0.54.0 Released</h4>

    <p>Another two months, another Vrapper release.  We've now received over
    50,000 installs via the Eclipse Marketplace, which puts us at number 42 out
    of all 1,800+ plugins available in the Marketplace.  Thank you everyone who
    continues to use and support Vrapper!</p>

    <p>We now have over 60 issues on our GitHub repository but I noticed
    something recently: there are only 11 defects.  Of course, since I'm the one
    who labels these items there are another 10 "annoyances", which are items
    that don't really prevent you from doing anything but would be nice to have.
    The reason I bring this up is because we have 35 feature requests.  Once
    again, it seems like Vrapper is at the point where we can meet the majority
    of user's use cases and we're down to the really obscure and difficult
    features that only power users even know exist.  Also, I don't think we have
    any feature requests which have a "me too!" comment in them; I think all of
    our feature requests each have one person waiting on them.  I may be a
    little biased, but I think Vrapper is one of the best Vim emulation plugins
    for any text editor. I'm not aware of any other Vim emulator that has
    support for additional (ported) vimscript plugins.  I think we're doing
    pretty good!</p>
    
    <p>Anyway, down to business.  0.54.0 includes the following changes since my
    last status update:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Added support for counts before an ex command (4:s/foo/bar/g)</li>
        <li>Added support for setting a register to the contents of another register (:let @*=@3)</li>
        <li>Fixed issue where indenting a block selection indented the beginning of the line</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with potential off-by-one when indenting a block selection</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with ':source' not interpreting '~' as '$HOME'</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with copying a block selection to the clipboard</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with restoring selection after toggling between visual mode and linewise visual mode</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with reverse search of a single character</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with stale selections potentially throwing an exception</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Updates to unstable update site</h4>
    <p>I'm still sticking with our monthly status updates.
    Here are the changes which are currently on our unstable update site:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Added new optional plugin for indent text object</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Useful with Python and other whitespace languages</li>
          <li>'ii' for indent block, 'ai' for indent block plus line above</li>
          <li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3037">http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3037</a></li>
        </ul>
        <li>Added support for ':let @/ = ""' to clear search highlight</li>
        <li>Introduced config property 'hlscope' to determine search highlight scope</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Only valid when ':set hlsearch' is active</li>
          <li>'window' - highlight the same keyword in all editors</li>
          <li>'clear' - only one editor will have a highlight at a time</li>
          <li>'local' - each editor has its own search highlight</li>
          <li>Default is 'clear'</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Fixed issue with 'c' and 's' in visual-block mode</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with XML editor provided by ADT</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with unintentionally recursive mappings</li>

    </ul>
</div>
<div class="newsbox">
    <div class="date">2015-02-11</div>
    <h4>0.52.1 Released</h4>
    <p>I just released 0.52.0 a couple days ago but a number of people quickly
    hit the same problem.  Certain command-line commands (such as :w and any
    mappings to an :eclipseaction) caused the editor to lose focus.  This meant
    you had to click your mouse within the editor to regain focus.  As Vim
    users, we all know how frustrating it is when your hands have to leave the
    keyboard to use the mouse.  So we fixed this issue and released 0.52.1 as
    quickly as we could. We apologize for any inconvenience.</p>
    
    <p>The only difference between 0.52.0 and 0.52.1 is that single defect fix:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Fixed issue where some command-line commands would cause the editor to lose focus</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div class="newsbox">
    <div class="date">2015-02-08</div>
    <h4>0.52.0 Released</h4>
    <p>While December was extremely slow for us, we did have some code changes
    in January so I'm sticking with our two-month release cycle and releasing
    0.52.0 today.  The following changes are in 0.52.0:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Added support for 'gn' and 'gN'</li>
        <li>Added support for ':buffer#' command and Ctrl-^</li>
        <li>Added support for 'C' in visual mode (alias for 'c' or 's')</li>
        <li>Changed ':ls' command to be ':files'</li>
        <li>Changed ':buffers' and ':ls' to be more vim-like</li>
        <li>Fixed issue where '/e' in search didn't work with regex</li>
        <li>Fixed issue where '&lt;c-=&gt;' couldn't be used in a mapping</li>
        <li>Fixed issue where canceling a search would also clear the visual selection</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>(Lack of) Status Update</h4>
    <p>It's been a month since 0.50.0 was released so I figured I should stick
    with my monthly status updates and tell you about the recent changes.
    However, there is nothing to report. Since 0.50.0 was released there hasn't
    been a single line of code changed and there hasn't been a single defect
    filed.  December is usually a slow month for us anyway, but I'm surprised we
    haven't had any defects filed either. I guess 0.50.0 must be a rock-solid
    release (or you guys must all be busy during December too).</p>
    <p>I hope you all enjoy Vrapper 0.50.0!</p>
</div>
<div class="newsbox">
    <div class="date">2014-12-07</div>
    <h4>0.50.0 Released</h4>
    
    <p>0.50.0 has been released, continuing with our two-month release cycle. At
    this point, I think I've been fully relegated to Project Manager status as
    albertdev has stepped up and handled basically all development in this
    release.  He's much better at this than I am and Vrapper is stronger for it.
    I'll take credit for resurrecting this project when the original authors
    abandoned it, but albertdev is the one who is able to fix the really
    difficult defects and introduce tough new features.  Thank you albertdev for
    your amazing work!</p>
    
    <p>The following changes are included in 0.50.0:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Added support for 'p'aste in visual block mode</li>
        <li>Added support for "* as a separate register on Linux</li>
        <li>Added support for the following 'clipboard' values: 'unnamedplus', 'autoselectplus', 'exclude:'</li>
        <li>Added support for 'g_' motion</li>
        <li>Added support for refreshing current file using ':e' with no arguments</li>
        <li>Added support for 'u' and 'U' in visual mode</li>
        <li>Fixed behavior of '{count}gT' to be more Vim-compliant</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with rendering command-line while scrolling</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with moving the cursor while in insert mode, then repeating</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with 'S' while on an empty line with Windows line-endings</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with eclipseaction in a vnoremap</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with ':reg' and ':marks' in Java 8</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with visual display of selecting a newline</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with incremental search highlight when match is under the cursor</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with editing certain configuration files in IBM's Rational Software Architect IDE</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Updates to unstable update site</h4>
    
    <p>It's been another month, time for your monthly status update with Vrapper.
    We've made the following changes on the unstable update site:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Added new "line" text object plugin</li>
            <ul>
            <li>'al' for column 0 to end-of-line</li>
            <li>'il' for first non-whitespace character to last non-whitespace character of a line</li>

            </ul>
        <li>Added support for 'gI' (insert at column 0)</li>
        <li>Added support for ':cmap'</li>
        <li>Fixed issue where word text objects would stop at unicode characters</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with 'O' on the line below a closed fold</li>
        <li>Fixed issue where 'q' (record macro) couldn't be re-mapped</li>

    <h4>0.48.0 Released</h4>
    
    <p>Vrapper version 0.48.0 has been released, back on schedule with our
    two-month release cycle.  The only changes since the last news post were
    more esoteric bug fixes. The following fixes are included in 0.48.0:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed issue with cursor placement after multi-line 'gp'</li>

        <li>Fixed issue with performing multiple searches while in visual mode</li>
        <li>Fixed issues with `[ and `] not updating after a delete or after 'p'</li>

    <h4>Updates to unstable update site<br/>(plus a minor rant)</h4>
    
    <p>Time for another monthly status update on Vrapper.  For the last couple
    years, our GitHub Issues page has hovered around 30 open defects/feature
    requests. Defects have been filed and fixed and we always seemed to have
    about 30 open at any given time.  This last month brought with it what I'm
    going to call some "overzealous" new users.  We jumped from having ~30
    defects to having over 50 in one month.  13 of those issues were filed by a
    single person.  Now, I don't take this as a sign that Vrapper is unstable. I
    may be overly optimistic here, but I think it's actually because Vrapper has
    reached a point where we meet about 95% of most users' use cases.  We're
    down to the esoteric features and nit-picking defects; which is to say, the
    really hard stuff.  Just take a look at the current changes on our unstable
    update site:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Added support for 'c_&lt;C-R&gt;_&lt;C-W&gt;' and 'c_&lt;C-R&gt;_&lt;C-A&gt;'</li>
        <ul>
        	<li>Insert word under cursor into command-line</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Added support for 'n' flag in substitutions</li>
        <ul>
         	<li>Count matches without performing substitution</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Fixed issue with using counts on a non-linewise paste</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with '}' in visual mode with ipmotion.vim plugin</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with 'incsearch' and '?' search mode</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with cursor position after a 'u' undo</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with ']' mark after deleting text</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with cursor position in visual mode when using "selection=exclusive"</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with performing multiple searches while in visual mode</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with enabling Vrapper while a text selection was active</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with pasting on an empty line with windows newlines</li>
        <li>Fixed issues with Vrapper interacting with Perforce plugin</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There are very few items in that list that I think are generally
    applicable or would affect a large number of users (and those are just the
    items we were able to fix).  Hopefully this is a sign that the majority of
    our users are happy with Vrapper.  Hopefully the majority of our users
    aren't even running into most of the defects we're fixing at this point.</p>
    
    <p>
    <b>**Changes in behavior**</b><br/>
	One last thing.  I removed a couple configurable options which nobody should've
	been using anyway.  We had support for <b>"saney"</b> and <b>"sanecw"</b> which would modify
	the behavior of 'Y' and 'cw' to be more consistent with other Vim commands
	(despite our 'Y' and 'cw' being consistent with Vim's 'Y' and 'cw').  I removed
	these options because Vim's own documentation says to use ":map Y y$" and ":map
	cw dwi" if you want that "sane" behavior.  I think our "saney" and "sanecw"
	options were added before Vrapper had support for ":map" but they are no longer
	necessary since we've had ":map" for a while now.</p>

    <h4>0.46.0 Released</h4>
    
    <p>If I was sticking closely to my two-month release cycle I would've released last week.
    However, there weren't too many changes in this release.  I also had just fixed a defect
    and I wanted to make sure my fix solved the problem.  Now, a week later, I'm releasing 0.46.0.
    Here are the changes since the last news post (included in 0.46.0):</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Changed 'syncmodifiable' to ignore Eclipse's readonly flag by default.  This should help some Perforce users.</li>
        <li>Fixed issue where selecting from the end of the line backwards would skip the last character</li>
        <li>Fixed issue where Vrapper would stay in VisualMode after Eclipse cleared the selection</li>
        <li>Fixed issue where a visual selection could jump to the beginning of the next line</li>
        <li>Fixed issue where Mac command key was ignored.  It is now treated as Ctrl.</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with 'i_Ctrl-Y' after 'A'.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Updates to Unstable update site</h4>
    
    <p>Another month, another status update for Vrapper.  In the past
    month, we've made the following changes to the unstable update site:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Added support for ':command' to define custom user commands</li>
        <li>Fixed issue where 'softtabstop' broke multi-character mappings (like 'imap jj &lt;esc&gt;')</li>
        <li>Fixed issue where you couldn't use unicode characters in .vrapperrc</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with mapping '0' to something then using counts for a command</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with 'R' replace mode at the end of a file</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with using &lt;TAB&gt; in a macro</li>
        <li>Fixed issue where you couldn't use a space in the right-hand side of a mapping</li>
        <li>Fixed issue preventing you from mapping '&lt;c-/&gt;' to anything</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Surround Plugin changes:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Added ability to define custom surrounds by editor type</li>
    	<ul>
            <li>au "Java" surround c /*\r*/</li>
            <li>au "XML"  surround c &lt;!--\r--&gt;</li>
    	</ul>
    </ul>

    <p>Split Editor Plugin changes:</p>

    <h4>0.44.0 Released</h4>
    
    <p>It seems we're still sticking with this 2-month release cycle.
    0.44.0 has been released and is primarily a bug-fix release with a ton
    of defects fixed.  In addition to last month's list of fixes, 0.44.0
    includes the following changes:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed XML tag 't' text object to ignore JSP tags</li>
        <li>Fixed issue where accidentally using XML tag 't' text object in a non-XML file would cause StackOverflowError</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with multi-character mappings affecting regular commands</li>
        <li>Fixed issue to keep cursor visible when swapping visual selection sides</li>
        <li>Fixed issue where named register was sometimes still active after an operation</li>
        <li>Modified behavior of new "syncmodifiable" property</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Now a string rather than a boolean, valid values are 'matchreadonly' and 'nosync'</li>
          <li>'matchreadonly' will set Vrapper's read-only flag to the state of Eclipse's read-only flag (this is the default)</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Other miscellaneous improvements of fixes made last month</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Split Editor Plugin changes:</p>
    <ul>

        <li>Fixed 'gt' behavior</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Added ':wincmd n/p' and '&lt;C-W&gt;gt/gT' (which can be mapped to 'gt/gT')</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Fixed issue where a cloned editor would place its cursor at the beginning of the file</li>

    <h4>Updates to unstable update site</h4>

    <p>Time for your monthly status update on Vrapper.  We've got another long
    list of changes in the last month since 0.42.0 was released.</p>
    
    <p>First of all, there was a defect in 0.42.0 where the '?' command (reverse
    search) simply didn't work. I was tempted to release a 0.42.1 with this
    defect fixed since it seems like such a fundamental feature. However, it
    actually took a couple weeks for anyone to find it.  This tells me that the
    '?' feature isn't actually used that often.  So we've fixed this defect on
    the unstable update site but I think it can probably wait for 0.44.0 to be
    in a stable release.  If you actually use the '?' feature a lot and noticed
    it was broken, you'll have to update to the latest unstable build or wait
    another month to receive the fix.  Sorry for breaking such a basic
    feature.</p>
    
    <p>On to the list of changes since 0.42.0 was released:</p>

        <li>Added support for searches with '\&lt;' and '\&gt;'</li>
        <ul>
           <li>Maps to Eclipse's '\b' regex; we're still using Java regex under the hood</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Fixed issue where 'scrolloffset' and 'scrolljump' were ignored when jumping to a mark</li>
        <li>Fixed issue where Vrapper appeared to modify read-only files</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Added 'modifiable' and 'syncmodifiable' to set 'modifiable' when Eclipse says the file is read-only</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Fixed issue where Vrapper would re-enable itself if Vrapper was disabled and text was selected (while 'visualmouse' option set)</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with cursor position in '(insert) VISUAL' mode</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with double-clicking to select a word in '(insert) VISUAL' mode</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with deleting too many pending characters during a mapping in InsertMode when unprintable key presses (Ctrl/Alt) were used </li>
        <li>Fixed long-standing annoyance where cursor would appear after the end of a line when clicking with the mouse</li>
        <li>Other various internal fixes (refactoring)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I occasionally like to include some shameless self-congratulation when
    releasing a new version.  I searched Twitter for 'Vrapper' and here are some
    of my favorite tweets about Vrapper.  Thank you for all the love!</p>
